# Go Exercises

This repo contains Go exercises extracted from real life code. The only
goal of this repo is to give you a way to practice your programming
skills. Solutions aren't provided.

Fork the repo and implement your own solutions.

## Contribute

If you've found some interesting code challenges/exercises extracted
from code you've found or wrote, please submit a PR.

Each exercise should have a `README.md` file explaining what the
exercise is all about. A test suite and an empty implementation file.
